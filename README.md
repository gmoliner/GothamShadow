Gotham Shadow is a browser 2D game, featuring Batman and some famous enemies !
Gotham Shadow is a personal development project, i'm a big fan of the Dark Knight and this game is a tribute. 
I wanted to learn basics of a 2D game, it was really enjoying to build a game engine from the bottom to something playable.

The game is inspired by the Pacman concept : player and enemies walks themselves through the grid, you just change the direction of your player. In Gotham Shadow, you play as Batman against enemies like Joker or Bane, and you have to get all fragment of lights dispatched in the map.

Use keyboard arrows to change Batman's direction and enjoy the game !
